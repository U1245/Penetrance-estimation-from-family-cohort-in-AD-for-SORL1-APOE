# example.txt is a simulated dataset 
# example.R is the R file able to estimate the age-related penetrance of Alzheimer disease at the digenic level (SORL1 and APOE)
# NB: Currently, to run this function, the user needs the "bped3alleles+2alleles" C++ function, available upon request. A R version of this function will be 
# available soon and the function described here will incorporate it.
